# Reckon-ng
a web reconnaisance framework

---

### Why?

Before you start an active attack it's really useful to **gather as much information** on your target as possible.

However, collecting all the information and keeping track of all data (e-mails, logins, accounts, names...) is rather a **repetitive and tedious task**.

### Web Reconnaisance framework
- helps you gather information from enterprise websites
- helps you map the information data and discover useful connections

### Reckon-ng

- written in Python 3
- easily extendable

#### From the author
```
Recon-ng has a look and feel similar to the Metasploit Framework,
reducing the learning curve for leveraging the framework.
However, it is quite different. Recon-ng is not intended 
to compete with existing frameworks, as it is designed
exclusively for web-based open source reconnaissance.
```

#### From the author
```
If you want to exploit, use the Metasploit Framework.
If you want to social engineer, use the Social-Engineer Toolkit.
If you want to conduct reconnaissance, use Recon-ng!
```
